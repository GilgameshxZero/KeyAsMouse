2.1.0
	added DiffMode, a different way mouse movement is processed, typically useful for applications where the mouse is fixed in a predetermined location, such as most FPSs or Minecraft
	added SlowMode, such that when a key is being held all scroll and mouse move accelerations are reduced by half
	added pause capability, which toggles the program functions, instead of turning it off directly like TerminateKey
	added WheelUpSingle/WheelDownSingle, two keys that send exactly one tick of the scroll wheel when pressed/held, unlike the WheelUp/WheelDown keys, which have physics applied to the scroll wheel
	cleaned up mouse messages to be adhere to standards more
